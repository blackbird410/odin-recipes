    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Risotto is a traditional Italian rice dish made 
        from a short-grained, starchy variety of rice 
        called Arborio rice. A properly cooked risotto 
        should form a soft, creamy mound on a dinner plate—it 
        shouldn't run across the plate, nor should it be stiff 
        or gluey. While not difficult, some essential tips will 
        help you make restaurant-worthy risotto at home.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups (1 quart) chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 medium shallot, chopped(about 1/2 cup; or 1/2 small onion, chopped)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry vermouth(or dry white wine)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps for cooking</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, heat the stock to a simmer. 
            Lower the heat so the stock stays hot while you cook the risotto.</li>
        <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil and 1 tablespoon of 
            the butter over medium heat. When the butter has melted, add the 
            chopped shallot or onion. Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes or until slightly 
            translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the rice to the pot and stir it briskly with a wooden spoon so that 
            the grains are coated with the oil and melted butter. Sauté for another 
            minute or so, until there is a slightly nutty aroma. Make sure not to 
            let the rice turn brown. </li>
        <li>Add the vermouth or wine and cook while stirring, until the liquid is 
            fully absorbed.</li>
        <li>Add a ladle of hot chicken stock to the rice and stir every once in a 
            while until the liquid is fully absorbed. When the rice appears almost 
            dry, add another ladle of stock and repeat the process.</li>
        <li>Continue adding stock, a ladle at a time, for about 20 minutes or until 
            the grains are tender but still firm to the bite, without being crunchy 
            (al dente).</li>
        <li>Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and the Parmesan cheese 
            and parsley. Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.</li>
        <li>Serve in bowls and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
