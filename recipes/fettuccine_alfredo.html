    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fettuccine alfredo is a classic Italian pasta dish 
        that is rich, creamy, and delicious. Tender 
        fettuccine noodles are tossed in a homemade alfredo 
        sauce made creamy with heavy cream, butter, and 
        Parmesan cheese, and seasoned with garlic, salt, 
        and pepper. When you are craving comfort food, nothing 
        is better than creamy pasta, and when you really need 
        some comfort, you want it asap. Luckily this simple 
        fettuccine alfredo comes together in less than 15 minutes. 
        Perfect for busy weeknights but fancy enough for date night.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fettuccine noodles</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps for cooking</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Cook the pasta.</strong> Bring a large pot of water 
            to a boil over medium-high heat. Add fettuccine noodles and 
            salt and cook until al dente (fully cooked but still firm) 
            according to package directions, about 2-3 minutes for fresh 
            fettuccine noodles and 8-10 minutes for dried noodles. 
            Reserve ½ cup pasta water and then drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sauté aromatic.</strong> In a large skillet, melt 
            butter over medium high heat for 1 minute. Add garlic and sauté 
            until fragrant, about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the alfredo sauce.</strong> Add heavy cream and 
            Parmesan cheese. Stir well and bring the sauce to a simmer. 
            Reduce heat to medium and keep stirring until thickened to a 
            desired consistency, about 3-4 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Toss in fettuccine noodles.</strong> Stir in cooked 
            fettuccine and toss well to combine. If you like it a bit saucier, 
            slowly add ¼ cup to ½ cup reserved pasta water and stir well to 
            combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve.</strong> Sprinkle extra parmesan and freshly ground 
            black pepper on top.
        </li>
